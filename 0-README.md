Acustica-Audio preamp library!

This is a library that contains snapshots of Acustica Audio plug ins preamp section. The idea is to collect them all, 
so you can use this library to look at, before you choose a preamp, so you can all make educated choices:

The snapshots are made using DDMF's awesome plug in analyser called Plug In Doctor:

Contributing to the library:
If you want to contribute to the library, you can. The more snapshots we have, the better the library is.


For now, contributions can be made by doing the following. (Contribution method will change soon):

1. 
Open Plug in Doctor and load the Acustica Audio plugin that you want to analyze and create a snapshot from and 
make sure that only the preamp is engaged in the plug in.

2. 
Push the small camera in top right corner of Plug In Doctor, to save the snapshot to disc.

3. 
Send the .png file to the email below, with clear information about which plug in the snapshot is from.
If there are more preamps in the plug in, then please include which number preamp it is.


Send snapshots to this email:   preamp-library@protonmail.com

Thanks, I hope you will enjoy the library.
